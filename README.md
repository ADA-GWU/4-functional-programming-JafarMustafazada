Assignment 4: "Do not try to achieve 100% - it can be done only with the formula".

Jafar on C++: "And I took that personally".

Time wasn't nearly big deal, program takes about 300ms when limit is 5s, but memory is another story. Since max 'n' is "10^8", array probably going to be "(10^8) * 4" bytes. It is about 382 MB when limit is 500. I was thinking of using two arrays of 'n' size but it was kicking limit so I figured I dont really need second array for 'move' operations.

Eolymp dosen't have F# ;-;

But writing same code from F# on Haskell is not big deal.
